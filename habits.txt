# Response to tip nr. 1
# I totally agree with TechLead about how difficult it is to sit behind the desk, and what it does to.
# the human body. My previous job was standing most of the time and it wasn't easy neither.
# If I have to compare it, then I find sitting most of the time more challenging than standing.
# Best way to prevent your body from harm is exercising.

# Get It Done attitude
# The code is wearing our name so we try to perfect it (or at least some of us),
# so that's the reason behind polishing it. Sure, as devs. it's not always in our hands to put it
# out to the world. We try to stand somewhere in the middleground between being proud and not ashamed of.

# Keep it simple/consistency
# Some over-engineering is brutal and many of us have hard time understanding the code.

# Consistent way to get into the "zone"
# True, but it highly depends on the environment and a person.
# For some people the best way to get into the zone is by being in office surrounded by co-workers.
# For others it's that battery being finally out from that annoying clock on the wall.

# Non-stop Learning & debug
# Finding ways in optimizing our smartness should be in our minds, but sometimes laziness kicks in :)

# Response to tip nr. 6
# Collaboration
# I think this is also caused by the facts that many people meets with the programming in young age
# and everybody wants to be a new Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg. Inspired by the great future,
# we are also scared of the code-thieves. But as soon as we find the value of god-solution-givers on
# stackoverflow.com, it might inspire us to be more opened and help each other to share more bytes per day.
